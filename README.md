## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture approach with a clear separation of concerns:

### Presentation Layer
- **Views**: UI components located in the `app/views` directory
- **Cubit/State**: State management using Flutter Bloc/Cubit pattern in the `core/cubits` directory
- **UI Kit**: Reusable UI components from the `shopapp_widgets` package

### Domain Layer
- **Models**: Data models representing the application entities in `core/network/models`
- **Repositories**: Interface definitions for data operations

### Data Layer
- **Repositories Implementations**: Actual implementation of repositories
- **Services**: API services using Retrofit and Dio for remote data
- **Local Storage**: Using Hive and SharedPreferences for local data

This architecture promotes:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones

## State Management

The application uses the BLoC pattern (through Cubit implementation) for state management:

1. **Cubits**: Handle business logic and maintain state
2. **States**: Represent different UI states (loading, success, error)
3. **Events**: Triggered by user interactions

This approach provides reactive UI updates and predictable state changes throughout the application.

## Localization

The app supports multiple languages using the `intl` package and `slang`. Translation files are located in the `app/l10n` directory.

## Backend Integration

Supabase serves as the primary backend solution providing:
- **Authentication**: User management and access control
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for storing application data
- **Storage**: File storage for product images and other assets

Firebase is used for push notifications to keep users updated about their orders and other activities.
